# _the get go_ :horse:
Minimalistic starter with Alpinejs, Microbundle, Husky, ESLint, and nano-css.

# Why?
Setting up pagest fast, with dependencies that excite me. 
Also, none of the boilerplate setup mumbo-jumbo; we wanna get to work!
Nevertheless; dependencies with nice syntax, and not just grabbin' a new copy of `create-react-app` straight away for every _simple_ project. **There's no need.**

# Which?
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)\
We want to work with data, make things interactive, and bind attributes. We can also just use React, right? Well, yes. We can. But we don't need to kill a fly with a machine gun, now do we. Let's not get overboard with the tools!
- [Spruce](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/spruce)\
I like trees, as you noticed. Also, we might want to save some data in our starter. This is what we call a state. Spruce and Alpine; a great pear of trees. Suited for the job.
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) (which uses [Rollup.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle)\
Developments need to be done on a server. And we want it to be _fast_. This does it. Also! We need to bundle all the stuff we use. This lets Rollup.js bundle everything when we put it on production.
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) + [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) + [Lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)\
Linting is fun and all, but we want to automate things. Run the linter pre-commit.
- [Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria)\
Well, I really like styled-components! And I like SASS, and clean CSS files! Looking around for a clean CSS-in-JS dependency (and there are loads of them!), I found this to be my fav.
- [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)\
User-agent styles are fun and all, but where we're going, we really aren't going to be needing those.

# When?
_Right now_.
