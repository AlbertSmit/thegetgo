# _the get go_ :horse:
Minimalistic starter with Alpinejs, Microbundle, Husky, ESLint, and nano-css.

# Why?
Setting up pagest fast, with dependencies that excite me. 
Also, none of the boilerplate setup mumbo-jumbo; we wanna get to work!
Nevertheless; dependencies with nice syntax, and not just grabbin' a new copy of `create-react-app` straight away for every _simple_ project. **There's no need.**

# Which?
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)\
**Why:**\
We want to work with data, make things interactive, and bind attributes. We can also just use React, right? Well, yes. We can. But we don't need to kill a fly with a machine gun, now do we. Let's not get overboard with the tools!\
- [Microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle)\
**Why:**\
It's a bit like Parcel (which I also really like), but it's a bit more neat and tidy. Also, when wanting to use TypeScript when scaling up; this supports it!\
- [Microenvi](https://github.com/fwilkerson/microenvi)\
**Why:**\
Things need to run in the browser. We're not coding for the sake of it.\
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)\
**Why:**\
Linting is fun and all, but we want to automate things. Run the linter pre-commit.\
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)\
**Why:**\
We need pretty and consistent code. Nothing more, nothing less. Makes coding a breeze. Also, hey, have some _standards_!\
- [nano-css](https://github.com/streamich/nano-css)\
**Why:**\
Well, I really like styled-components! And I like SASS, and clean CSS files! Looking around for a clean CSS-in-JS dependency (and there are loads of them!), I found this to be my fav.\
- [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)\
**Why:**\
User-agent styles are fun and all, but where we're going, we really aren't going to be needing those.

# When?
_Right now_.
